###Parents agree you've got to start saving now.###

Investments soon add up. The earlier you can start saving for your kids’ education, the better. 17% of UAE parents already have an education savings plan in place (according to HSBC’s influential 2017 Value of Education report). Join them, by taking a realistic look with your IFA at the costs and savings options involved.

Over half of UAE parents report that they wish they had started saving earlier for their childrens’ education.

RP Financial offers assistance in setting up education savings plans as well as trusts and other legal ways of paying for education efficiently.
