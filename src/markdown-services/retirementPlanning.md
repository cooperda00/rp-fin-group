###Get active now for a stress-free retirement###

Retirement planning might sound premature to many but here at RP Financial, we have plenty of experience in helping clients to safeguard their retirement, no matter how far away it might seem right now, without making it a burden on your current lifestyle. All you need to do to get started is to find out what we can do for you.

You may think that retirement is too far away to worry about, but the years go ever faster and if you start early you will be pleased that you did as it will not be running to catch up.

Many of us look forward to retirement as the chance to take a well-earned break from the stresses of working life, or to have the choice to work far less. But without a solid financial plan in place, expats, in particular, can find themselves struggling. Our advisers help you plan the bigger financial picture, bringing together your retirement plan (how you fund your retirement) with your legacy plan (what you leave your family).

It is sensible to cater for the possibility of expensive long-term care, as well as for a robust legacy strategy to look after your family when you have passed away.

We offer experienced and coordinated advice on UK state pensions, pension transfers, saving for retirement, investments generally, will writing, trusts, and funding options for long-term care.
