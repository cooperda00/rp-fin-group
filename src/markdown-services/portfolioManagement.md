Our managed portfolios give you wide-ranging choices, whatever your reason for saving, with a range of five risk-rated portfolios bringing together some of the world’s largest money managers, you are sure to find one that suits.


Should you require more tailored solutions for trust or tax planning, then our qualified advisers can access the diverse range of in-house expertise, draw on RP Financial's extensive strategic relationships, and bring together in-depth technical expertise developed over two decades, to provide you with the answers and solutions you need.


Your portfolio will be reinforced by the three pillars of our investment strategy that we have built up over 15 years of successful investment:


* **Dynamic investment**. Dynamic asset allocation to optimise your investment over time in line with market conditions.

* **Diversified investment**. Enhanced portfolio diversification beyond the usual blend of stocks, bonds and cash.

* **Robust investment**. Pragmatic fund selection means the freedom to mix and match passive (Index Trackers, ETFs) and actively-managed funds.

To offer that final reassurance, our clients can relax knowing that our portfolios are registered in Luxembourg and Dublin, two of the world’s largest and most regulated exchanges globally, ensuring your capital remains safe and secure at all times.As with any investment, RP Financial cannot guarantee that you will get back what capital you put in, but we can reduce and smooth out those bumps in the investment road. Our portfolios are designed to weather volatile markets and deliver long-term financial success.
